Xcel-LIDAR-Viewer
This repository hosts a simple CesiumJS application on GitHub Pages to visualize a LIDAR dataset from a Cesium ion asset.

ðŸ‘‰ Live demo: https://allenaidash.github.io/Xcel-LiDAR-Viewer/

How it Works
The site is a static index.html file located in the /docs folder of this repository.

GitHub Pages is configured to serve the site directly from the /docs folder on the main branch.

CesiumJS is loaded via a Content Delivery Network (CDN), meaning no local installation is required.

The viewer connects to Cesium ion to load a specific 3D Tiles dataset using an access token.
