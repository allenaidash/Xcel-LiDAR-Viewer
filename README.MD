# Cesium Demo on GitHub Pages

This repo hosts a simple CesiumJS viewer on **GitHub Pages**, loading a Cesium ion asset.

ðŸ‘‰ Live demo: [https://<your-username>.github.io/cesium-demo/](https://<your-username>.github.io/cesium-demo/)

---

## How it works
- The site is a static `index.html` located in the `docs/` folder.
- GitHub Pages is configured to serve from the `/docs` folder.
- CesiumJS is loaded directly from the CDN (`jsDelivr`).
- The viewer connects to **Cesium ion** using an access token.
